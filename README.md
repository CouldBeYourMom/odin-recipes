My Odin Recipes Project                   March 18, 2022

Day 3 into The Odin Project for me. I am going to create a basic recipie website, showcasing the skills I have learned. It will have a main index page with links to a few recipes. I will utilize a mastered boilerplate, lists, links, images, and proper commit messages. 

My sister, Nicole, put together family recipes using google docs last summer. I will working on committing that, along with my personal recipes, to the web.
