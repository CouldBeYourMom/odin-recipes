    <p>
        This recipe makes 2 large pans (9 x 13 and at least 3 inches deep). I make one to eat that night and freeze the other one for an easy meal another night. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients for Mash</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large sweet potatoes, chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>4 Tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp fresh rosemary, chopped</li>
            <li>1 head of garlic, roasted (I cut to top off the entire head, remove all the extra paper-y outside, drizzle with olive oil, wrap in foil, the bake at 400 for about 45 minutes)</li>
            <li>1 tsp fresh ground pink salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp fresh ground pepper</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients for Filling</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 lb ground beef (would also be great with ground lamb)</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp Olive Oil</li>
            <li>1 sweet onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1.5 cups diced carrots</li>
            <li>1 can cut green beans (drained)</li>
            <li>1 can sweet corn (drained)</li>
            <li>1 can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp flour</li>
            <li>1 cup red wine (I used Apothic Inferno because it was aged in whisky barrels)</li>
            <li>1 - 1.5 cups beef stock</li>
            <li>3-4 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>3-4 sprigs of thyme</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Brown the meat. Set drained meat aside and discard the grease.</li>
            <li>Put the oil into the pan, add the vegetables and cook on a gentle heat until soft, about 20 mins.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and flour, increase the heat and cook for a few mins, then return the beef to the pan.</li>
            <li>Pour over the wine, if using, and boil to reduce it slightly before adding the stock, Worcestershire sauce and herbs.</li>
            <li>Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 45 mins. By this time the gravy should be thick and coating the meat. Check after about 30 mins - if a lot of liquid remains, increase the heat slightly to reduce the gravy a little. Season well, then discard the bay leaves and thyme stalks.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the mash. In a large saucepan, cover the potatoes in cold water, bring to the boil and simmer until tender.</li>
            <li>Drain well, then allow to steam-dry for a few mins. Mash well with the cream, butter, and seasons.</li>
            <li>Spoon meat into 2 ovenproof dishes. Pipe or spoon on the mash to cover. Heat oven to 350° and cook for 25-30 mins, or until the gravy is bubbling. </li>
        </ol>
